Hey, so I just stumbled out of The Electric State, and wow... it's like my brain's been dropped in a blender and just switched on to muddle. Can't even hear myself think over this damn noisy theater lobby, some kid's tossing popcorn like confetti, and I've got this achy-kinda feeling like I've been wrestling with the seat cushions for hours or whatever.

Man, the colors in that  ! They just bleed into your eyes like spilled paint across a highway. The sky almost seemed to stretch into infinity, like it could just wrap around you and swallow you whole—feels like a dream left on the bus that you can't quite remember but it's on the tip of your brain, y'know? It's got that glitchy hum like the static fuzz from old TV sets, all wrapped in a future that's tethered to memories wearing rose-colored goggles. Kinda like my old Gameboy tangled in 𝘮𝘰𝘥ern VR, mashed up together.

> And the characters, they move through that world like they're part of some forgotten vinyl soundtrack—soft and 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ling at the edges. I think there's this scene, with a robot who looks like it got splashed with moonlight—it moved, acted, almost with this pet-like curiosity, makes you miss your childhood toys like crazy. Just can't shake that image, no way. Wasn't there some sort of silent agreement there that someday these metal chunks might be more human than us? Wild.

I keep getting flashes of those abandoned landscapes—weirdly comforting, in that post-apocalyptic kinda way. Made me feel like I should probably 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   when it’s out, need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again, like replaying old cassette tapes that never quite lined up right.

And this one conversation kept looping in my head—felt like squinting at a puzzle with missing pieces. Smelled like burnt metal or maybe just my imagination running a marathon without me. The theater's buzz is still rattling the hallway, someone definitely dropped a soda back there. Sticky mess lurking near my feet.

> Oh right, you wanted to know if you should get it or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Totally, if you're into being mentally tangled up and spit back out in a whirl. It's sorta inspirational in a messy, chaotic way. Like trying to ride a bike upside down, while reading a graphic novel that's unraveling down the spine. Something like that.

Anyway, why's my head playing bits in loops? Gotta shake this feeling off, or probably just walk it off, though the sun's setting like it's been drowned in honey or something. Strange. 

```javascript
function dreamLoop(recall, reality) {
   while (mindBlurred) {
     if (reality == undefined) break;
     recall += electric state;
     if (canRemember) return recall;
   }
}
```

Alright, uh, catch you later? Brain's mush.
